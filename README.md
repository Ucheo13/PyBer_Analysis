# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
In this project we have the assignment of having to use the skills we have learned in order to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Additionally, we must use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multi-line graph showing the total weekly fares in terms of each city type. Using these to determine how the differences can be used by PyBer.
## Results 
There are clear differences in the ride-sharing data among the different city types. The first noticeable difference is in the total rides and therefore total drivers. Urban cities need rides the most considering the fact there are many more things to do and much more people working in these areas. They are also generally more populated. With Suburban being less than Urban type cities and more than Rural type cities. The total fares of course coincide with these facts with Urban being much higher than Suburban and Suburban being higher than Rural type cities. But the average fare per ride is where this changes, because the lower demand causes the price to be higher and therefore the driver fare as well. With Rural having the lowest demand it has the highest fare per ride and per driver. With urban being the lowest.
Analyzing the effect on ride fare totals during different months shows that there is a decently similar trend for each city type. With a spike in end of February, and their similar low points in the start of January. But there are some differences in the drop mid April for Rural and Suburban while Urban fare stays high.

## Summary 
It is recommended that there is more focus on supplying rides in Urban cities in comparison to the others so the wait time for the customers. Also, that each month should be treated as equal considering the fares do not vary by too much over time. And finally, the average fare per driver should be a more equal ratio considering the average fare by ride does not vary by more than $10. The Urban City drivers should be getting more while Rural should be getting less.
