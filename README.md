## Overview of the Analysis
The schoolboard has recognized evidence of academic dishonestly, specifically for the reading and math grades for the ninth graders in Thomas High School. So, what we must do to help the school board is replace those grades with NaNs to be able to repeat the school district analysis excluding the altered information.

## Results 
•	The district summary was not affected by much. The passing percentages stayed relatively the same 
•	The school summary was affected a lot by the changes. Passing percentages went from being in the high 60s to being in the 90s 
•	Thomas High School is now in the top 5 for high schools in overall passing percentage, specifically second 
•	Replacing the ninth-grade scores only affects the ninth-grade math and reading scores and not the other grades. As well as have little affect on the scores by size, spending range, and district

## Summary
In summary the ninth-grade math and reading scores being replaced with NaNs did have an affect on some aspects of the summary. The district summary was not as affected as well as the scores by grade, size, and spending. But the school summary was affected by a lot in the passing percentages. There was a total increase in math and reading when the ninth-grade was removed. As well as Thomas High School being second for high schools in overall passing percentage.
